# Hate-Speech-Detection-WebApp
A web app in which a trained logistic model will predict whether a comment / tweet entered by the user is hate speech or not. If hate speech is detected then it will not get published
to a dashboard else it will be visible in the dashboard. In Machine Learning component we have used BoW model with Term Frequency. Different models were tested on the dataset and evaluated.
Logistic Regression gave the highest performance metrics hence it was used.
